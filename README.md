# GraphAlgorithms
This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental graph algorithms on a directed graph with 9 vertices. Algorithms include BFS traversal, cycle detection, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall for shortest paths. Additionally, Kruskal’s algorithm is applied on the undirected version of the same graph. The project tests both positive and negative edge weights, highlighting algorithm behavior under different conditions. 

📌 Algorithms implemented:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Cycle Detection
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Kruskal’s Algorithm (for undirected graph)

🛠️ Language used:  Java
